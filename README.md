ideas:
- make the maskot interractable: make a hat on the bottom-left that has blinking eyes from time-to-time and when it is clicked then the phoenix "POOFs" and appears. Make it be able to be moved around and de-summonned
- make the top part of the homepage animated on scroll with a short animation - probably using svg animations like 1 of the saved examples
- create emojis so that the visitors can react to projects/posts
